# Restaurant-Java

I made a Java app capable of administering a restaurant, where you can login as a client or employee/admin. I implemented the possibility to run CRUD commands on every object, I made CSV files that simulate a database and an audit file.

This project is a work in progress, because I want to modify the app so that it will work with a real database.
